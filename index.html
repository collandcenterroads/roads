        <p class="mb-4">
          A PID lets homeowners vote to levy an additional property‑tax assessment earmarked for road maintenance. Key points:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li><strong>Dedicated Funding:</strong> by law the funds can be used only for the specified infrastructure(Road maintenance/upkeep).</li>
          <li><strong>Predictable Costs:</strong> small annual payments avoid sudden large repair bills.</li>
          <li><strong>Democratic Control:</strong> with the help of the Roads and Bridges department we set the scope of work, and governing board.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Formation Checklist</h4>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 mb-4">
          <li>Pay $100 application fee.</li>
          <li>Engineering Dept. will come out and assess our roads and determine the scope of work that will be necessary, as well as give a rough timeline for when the work would need to be done.</li>
          <li>The report will lay out the long term costs associated with the options of doing nothing, doing repairs, and doing a full repaving, as well as a recommendation for what should be done.</li>
          <li>Larimer County will generate a petition for our community to circulate and sign. We will also need three individuals to act as representatives of our neighborhood to interface with the county.</li>
          <li>Gather petition signatures (≥ 30% of property owners).</li>
          <li>Public meeting will be held to discuss the formation of the PID.</li>
          <li>Submit petition to county commissioners.</li>
          <li>Added to the Nov. ballot for the neighborhood to vote on(≥ 50% of property owners to pass).</li>
          <li>County Commissioner will determine the mill levy required to afford the project.</li>

          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How come this is happening now? Can we vote someone out of office to get this changed?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">Back in 1994 the county decided they would no longer be handling the maintenance of subdivision roads. But the actual cost of paving and owning the road has always been the responsibility of the subdivision owners. It would have been best to have something created in 1994 so we wouldn't have to deal with this now, but unless anyone has access to a time machine, we have to figure something out now.</p>

          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What is a PID?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPvVND_fzCI?rel=0" target="_blank">Here</a> is a youtube video explaining what a PID(Public Improvement Disctric) is, and how it works. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mPvVND_fzCI?rel=0" target="_blank">Click to view youtube video</a></p>

              If we decide to create the PID, how will the levy be applied? Will businesses pay more?
            </summary>
            <p class="mt-2">
              Yes &mdash; any parcel that gains ingress via our streets would be included in the assessment. The levy is based on the county‑assessed property value, so higher‑valued commercial lots will contribute proportionally more than residential ones.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How many property owners are their in our neighborhood?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">There are 184 owners in our neighborhood, you can see the map <a href="https://www.larimer.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/2017/colland_center.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> (Note that for some reason they have more than 1 parcel numbered with the same number). <a href="https://www.larimer.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/2017/colland_center.pdf" target="_blank">Link to Colland Center Map</a></p>

          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">How are the funds managed/handled if we form a PID?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">Our property taxes would increase and the increase would be put into an interest bearing account. No individual in the neighborhood would have direct access to it. The funds would only be able to be used to road maintenance/repairs. The Roads & Bridges Dept. would help us to find vendors and accept proposals.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I already pay taxes to Larimer County, how come I need to pay more?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">The taxes we're currently paying to Larimer County for roads are used to maintain the public roads. Larimer County doesn't maintain any subdivision roads. All subdivision either have their own PID/HOA to manage it, or they are doing nothing about it.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I don't trust the government and don't want them involved, can we still do something?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">Yes, instead of setting up a PID we could coordinate setting up a bank account for the neighborhood and having individuals pay into it. We would have to find a trustworthy person to manage it to limit the chance of theft/fraud. Additionally we would need to come up with a way to ensure/force that everyone is paying thier fair share.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">I don't want to pay for this, can't we just wait and let someone else pay for it?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">Currently Larimer County is experiencing a shortfall for the public roads, you can find more info here<a href="https://fhu.mysocialpinpoint.com/invest-larimer" target="_blank">(Link to shortfall info)</a>. The count doesn't have funds for the public roads, let alone to take on the cost of all subdivision roads.</p>
          </details>
          <details class="bg-white rounded-xl shadow p-4">
            <summary class="font-semibold cursor-pointer">What happens if I don't want to form a PID, but after voting more than 50% do, will I be forced to be a part of it?</summary>
            <p class="mt-2">Yes, all property owners in the neighborhood will be assessed the new levy. If you feel that strongly about it, the only option would be to move.</p>
